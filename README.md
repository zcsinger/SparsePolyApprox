# Vegetation-Banding

## Overview

The following are code excerpts as part of a Mathematics REU. Numerical simulations written in MATLAB include arclength continuation methods, direct simulation of a system of partial differential equations using finite differences, and programs for generating figures.

## Background on Project

There are many instances in nature where vegetation growth in dryland environments displays a band-like pattern formation. Our goal is to expand on the work done for a simple model between *w* the water concentration and *b* the biomass concentration.

At the end of the project a LaTeX document will accompany the files for full exposition.
