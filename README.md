# Vegetation-Banding

The following are code excerpts as part of a Mathematics REU. Mostly numerical simulations follow for creating and modifying interfaces of simple biomass vegetation with advection.

There are many instances in nature where vegetation growth in dryland environments displays a band-like pattern formation. Our goal is to expand on the work done for a simple model between w the water concentration and b the biomass concentration. 

At the end of the project a LaTeX document will accompany the files for full exposition.
